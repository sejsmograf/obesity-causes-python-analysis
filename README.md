# Analysis of the Relationship between Obesity and Socio-Economic Factors in Different Countries


## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to learn how to clean, process and analyse data. The conclusions were *underwhelming*, but this project is about the journey, not the destination :). 

## Used technologies
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- LaTex (first time I've used it, and i fell in love with it)

## Introduction
This project was created as part of Systemic and Decision Methods Course I've taken at Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology.
The goal was to analyze the relationship between obesity rates in various countries and other factors. 
The inspiration for this topic is alarming, and constanly growing obesity rate all around the world. 
There has been a steady increase in the number of individuals affected by obesity across different age groups,
posing a significant public health challenge and impacting overall quality of life.



## Methodology
The study began with an initial data analysis to examine the dynamics of global obesity trends over the years. 

In the next step, modeling was undertaken using available data from 2016. Regression models and other modeling techniques were employed to predict obesity levels based on the analyzed independent variables.

## Data
The source code containing data acquisition, cleaning, and standardization is provided in the file `gather_and_clean_data.ipynb`.


### Preprocessing
Data preprocessing involved cleaning and standardizing the datasets to ensure consistency and relevance.
This included removing unnecessary columns, handling missing values, and standardizing country names.


## Modeling
### Used Models
- **Linear Regression**
- **Generalized Linear Model**
- **Support Vector Regression**


## Results
After testing the different regression models, the results were compiled and visualized.

## Conclusions
The analysis revealed significant correlations between obesity rates and the analyzed socio-economic factors. However, the quality of the models varied depending on the data split. Due to the limited amount of data, the choice of data points was crucial and could affect the accuracy of the models.
